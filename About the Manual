The Mortgage Origination Compliance Audit Manual is a comprehensive, regulator-aligned framework designed to help financial institutions, auditors, and compliance officers conduct structured audits in the mortgage finance sector. It bridges U.S. federal regulatory requirements with global AML/CFT standards, ensuring organizations are regulator-ready and risk-resilient.

This manual covers every layer of the compliance ecosystem:

Regulatory Coverage – Fully aligned with U.S. federal laws including the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), USA PATRIOT Act, OFAC Sanctions Programs, FinCEN Guidance, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), Truth in Lending Act (TILA), RESPA, SAFE Act, ECOA, FCRA, FDCPA, UDAAP, and global standards like FATF Recommendations.

Audit Methodology – Provides risk-based, evidence-driven checklists for governance, AML/CFT controls, sanctions compliance, customer due diligence (KYC/CDD/EDD), transaction monitoring, fraud detection, employee training, and recordkeeping.

Risk Assessment Framework – Introduces a structured Low/Medium/High scoring system based on severity, likelihood, transaction volume, and historical performance, enabling tailored risk mitigation strategies.

Operational Testing – Includes sampling methods for customer files, STR/CTR reports, sanctions screening logs, monitoring alerts, and governance documents to ensure control effectiveness.

Governance and Oversight – Reinforces the importance of board-level accountability, compliance officer independence, ethics, and tone-from-the-top in shaping a sustainable compliance culture.

Small Institution Adaptability – Recognizes resource constraints by allowing video-conference-based audits for small MSBs/mortgage lenders, with controlled PDF reporting and sealed Original in Custody (OIC) documentation.

By combining checklists, regulatory references, risk models, and evidence requirements, the manual equips practitioners with a ready-to-deploy tool for mortgage origination compliance audits. It is designed to reduce compliance gaps, prevent regulatory penalties, and promote a culture of financial integrity.
